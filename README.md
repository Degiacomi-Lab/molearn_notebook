# Analysis and usage of molearn

This repository contains two notebooks:
* `molearn analysis.ipynb`: a tutorial showing in detail how to interact with a trained neural network, and how to analyse its performance
* `molearn_GUI.ipynb`: a demonstration of a graphical user interface used to  display a neural network latent space, and exploit it to generate protein conformations. This jupyter acts as a frontend of classes implemented in `analysis.py`.
