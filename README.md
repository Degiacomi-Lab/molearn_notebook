# Analysis and usage of molearn

[molearn](https://github.com/Degiacomi-Lab/molearn) is a generative neural network trainable with protein conformations. This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, describing how to interact with a trained network:

* `molearn analysis.ipynb`: a tutorial showing in detail how to interact with a trained neural network, and how to analyse its performance
* `molearn_GUI.ipynb`: a demonstration of a graphical user interface used to  display a neural network latent space, and exploit it to generate protein conformations. This notebook acts as a frontend of classes implemented in `analysis.py`.
